# CS230-Software-Design-Template

*Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

- Our client, The Gaming Room, has a game, Draw it or Lose it, that's already available on Android systems and they would like to make it available on other platforms. This game was a guessing game that provided images for the players as clues. The imades would fully render over time and the player only had a little longer to guess. The other team had a chance to steal the win if the current team didn't get the answer. There was no cap on how many teams or players that were allowed and the game was to be avaialble to play online with others.

*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

- I felt that the main part I did well was explaining what the client was looking for. I could break it down into different parts for each detail. Offering suggestions was easy enough but my explanantion on why they would be the best option needed work.

*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

- 

*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

- 

*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

- 

*How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
