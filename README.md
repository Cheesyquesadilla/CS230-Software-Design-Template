-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

 Our client, The Gaming Room, has a game, Draw it or Lose it, that's already available on Android systems and they would like to make it available on other platforms. This game is a guessing game that provides images for the players as clues. The imades would fully render over time and the player only had a little longer to guess. The other team had a chance to steal the win if the current team didn't get the answer. There was no cap on how many teams or players that were allowed and the game was to be avaialble to play online with others.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

 I felt that the main part I did well was explaining what the client was looking for. I could break it down into different parts for each detail. Offering suggestions was easy enough but my explanantion on why they would be the best option needed work.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

 Since we did not actually develope the code for this particular program I cannot say that it helped me to devlope anything, however I can see how the design document would be a very helpful step in working towards developing the software. By having a well put together design document it would then be easier to develope the psuedocode for the software because you would have the requirements laid out in short, sweet, to the point sentences without extra or unnecessary detaals cluttered in. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The part I would revise would be the chart about Mac, Linux, Windows and Mobile devices advantage points and weaknesses. In order to improve it I would make sure I did a lot more reliable research on each operating system.  This could be done by going to each one's wedsites to find information about the platform like what code is typically used, Ide's and so on. Other sources that could be used are articles on reputable websites that mention if anything is required before developing software that runs on that system, related costs, or if it's possible to develope something that can be universal for a couple systems.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  Honestly, I didn't think to much about the user's needs when working on the design document and I should have. The end user experience is very important since the software is to be devloped to be used. If software is inaccessible, hard to navigate, or crashes then it will not be used as much which means lowers clientele and revenue.  

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Considering I have yet to create any kind of indepth software, this question is kind of hard to answer. With the limited knowledge of coding I have at the moment, I would say that always making a software design document would be my first step. My next step would be to create the psuedocode for the program based on the requirements laid out on the document. Next would be to develope the code in small sections while building and runnning (if possible at that point in developement) to ensure the code is running smoothly. Revisions will of course be helpful as new information or expertise is gained.
